# Screenplay Writing Core

Use this as the primary, self-contained writing contract for screenplay creation, revision, diagnosis, scene repair, and dialogue work. The state engine is a later verification tool, not the source of the story.

## Required Knowledge Loading

All runtime writing rules are defined in this file and the local references named by `local-knowledge-map.md`.

Read the current files themselves; seeing these paths is not enough.

- New original screenplay from a blank brief, concept, or theme: use this file's premise, causal action, character, dialogue, emotional behavior, and anti-AI sections.
- Complete multi-scene original screenplay or complete rewrite: additionally apply the full conflict, theme, character-arc, antagonist, pressure-chain, opening/payoff, turn/climax, scene-deletion, and scene-entry/exit checks in this file. Do not reduce the full profile to a sample.
- Story seed or outline repair: use the core premise and diagnosis questions first, then add only the character, conflict, theme, or structure checks required by the problem.
- Single-scene, character, or dialogue repair: use the exact matching sections here; dialogue work always includes purpose and subtext, generated or over-polished text includes the anti-AI pass, and action/emotion work includes externalized behavior and restraint.
- Serious, complete, full, or explicitly excellent screenplay work: also read `screenplay-exemplar-benchmarks.md` and complete its internal mechanism-calibration receipt.
- AI-video, AI-comic, or prompt-ready screenplay work: complete the readable story and state verification first, then read `screenplay-ai-execution-compiler.md`. Its subject-binding and action-chain rules belong to the execution layer, not automatically to the human-readable master.

Do not claim that a local writing module was used unless its actual section was applied in the current task.

## 1. Tell The Whole Story In Plain Language

Before scene headings or polished dialogue, state internally:

```text
who wants what
+ why action is required now
+ who or what blocks it
+ what the character does first
+ what that action causes
+ how the character changes approach
+ what final choice is made
+ what it costs
```

Write it as a short causal account a normal reader could retell. If it becomes a list of themes, objects, rules, or moods, the story is not ready.

Before continuing, run an opening-comprehension gate on roughly the first 30--60 seconds or first 200--300 Chinese characters. A fresh reader should be able to identify the current place, whose immediate problem they are following, what that person is trying to do now, and the first resistance. Do not stack several unexplained names, roles, props, rules, and visual details before this anchor is clear. Mystery may withhold the answer; it may not withhold the basic situation the audience is meant to follow.

Hard gates:

- The protagonist's actions must cause or materially change the main events.
- The ending must result from prior actions and choices, not from a late fact, phone call, arrival, confession, or convenient object.
- The cost must be concrete. Embarrassment, danger, money, trust, status, work, love, freedom, or bodily risk must actually be put at stake; vague discomfort is not enough.
- Before locking a dilemma, test the obvious social and institutional routes as well as physical ones: ask, disclose, call, negotiate, substitute, delay, cancel, report, leave, or accept a smaller loss. If a reasonable person would try one, the story must show the attempt changing the situation or establish from current evidence why it is unavailable. A printed rule, deadline, or character saying `only A or B` is not proof.
- Re-run the alternative test whenever new evidence, a repair, an arrival, or a changed physical condition reopens the option set. An alternative ruled out earlier may become available later; the climax cannot keep using an expired blocker.
- If a normal reader cannot say what happened and why, do not outline scenes yet.

## 2. Make Character Behavior Inevitable, Not Convenient

For every major action, answer internally:

```text
what the character knows now
what they want now
what they fear or protect
what action they choose
why this action makes sense to them
what obvious safer, cheaper, or easier alternative exists
why they do not take that alternative
what consequence their action creates
```

The obvious-alternative test is mandatory. If an available simple action would solve the problem and the text gives no reason to reject it, the chosen action is author convenience. Change the conditions or change the action.

Give important characters at least one pressure-revealing protection behavior when appropriate: denial, deflection, concealment, repetition, a small mistake, saving face, or swallowing words. Do not turn this into a mandatory gimmick in every scene.

Every consequential supporting character also needs an independent want, risk, or cost that can pull them away from their apparent dramatic function. If replacing the person with a rule, warning, deadline, or conscience speech leaves the story essentially unchanged, the character is still a plot device. Let new evidence change at least one supporting character's judgment or chosen action, and allow that person to make a credible mistake or self-protective compromise.

## 3. Build Scenes From Action And Consequence

Each scene must be understandable without the author's explanation:

```text
entry situation
-> someone wants an immediate result
-> they act on another person or the physical world
-> resistance changes the situation
-> the character adapts or refuses
-> the scene ends with a new fact, relationship, choice, cost, or physical condition
-> that change creates the next scene
```

Do not begin with dialogue written to explain the premise. First know what the people are physically doing, stopping, hiding, taking, returning, refusing, damaging, repairing, or leaving.

## 4. Write Dialogue As Behavior

Apply the dialogue-purpose and subtext rules in this section before polishing lines.

- Give each speaker a concrete purpose: obtain, conceal, test, attack, delay, bargain, save face, force a choice, or end contact.
- Let the surface line differ from the hidden purpose when the character has something to protect.
- Permit interruption, repetition, correction, misunderstanding, silence, topic shift, incomplete sentences, and non-answers when they are motivated and affect the listener.
- Do not make every sentence deliver new plot information.
- Hide speaker labels. If the voices become interchangeable, rewrite from what each person notices, fears, protects, and is willing to do.
- Clear dialogue means the audience understands the conflict and changing choices. It does not mean every character speaks completely or explains their motive.

Run an ordinary-speech pass before delivery:

- For each consequential reply, first ask what the person actually heard and what they would naturally say or do next in this relationship. Do not let the line answer the writer's outline instead of the previous person.
- Prefer one immediate social move per line. Split or roughen a sentence that conveniently contains the conclusion, missing background, motive, and justification together.
- A valid tactic or listener effect does not by itself make the wording natural. If a simpler everyday paraphrase preserves the action while the polished line mainly packages a setup, clue, or payoff, rewrite the line.
- Read the exchange aloud or paraphrase it in everyday speech. If every line is unusually concise, quotable, logically complete, and perfectly timed, rewrite from the speaker's habit, embarrassment, status, impatience, or need to protect themselves. Do not manufacture stutters or filler as decoration.

## 5. Remove Generated Neatness

Apply the anti-AI diagnosis and rewrite procedure in this section.

Reject drafts where:

- characters summarize the theme;
- motives are fully explained instead of exposed by behavior;
- every reply is equally concise, intelligent, and symmetrical;
- every prop exists only to be paid off;
- the world has no ordinary friction, delay, mistake, or irrelevant human behavior;
- the ending closes every object and line so neatly that the writer's mechanism is more visible than the people.

Life friction must arise naturally from the setting and people. Do not add random clutter merely to satisfy a checklist.

## 6. Compile For AI Only After The Story Passes

When the user explicitly requests an AI-executable screenplay, an AI-comic/AI-video production script, or repair of model-confusing action, preserve the readable screenplay as the semantic master and use `screenplay-ai-execution-compiler.md` for a separate compilation pass.

Do not respond to a weak story by adding more bodily detail. Causality, current objective, relationship pressure, dialogue purpose, choice, and cost must already work. Do not mechanically repeat character names, explain every transition, or attach a visible reaction to every line in an ordinary screenplay. Those devices are conditional disambiguation tools for machine execution.

## 7. Calibrate, Verify, Then Deliver

For serious screenplay work:

0. When the user is testing the Skill or calibrating a new direction and did not explicitly request a full-length script, deliver a 2--3 minute sample first: normally 2 scenes, 2--3 speaking characters, and about 800--1200 Chinese characters. Before showing it, run the cold-read protocol against only the raw sample. Use a fresh ordinary reader or isolated context only when that capability is explicitly available and allowed; otherwise label the pass `SELF-AUDIT ONLY`. Mark any unclear opening fact, unreconstructable physical action, and up to three lines that do not sound spontaneously speakable; two or more consequential writer-shaped lines require revision. Do not expand into a long script until the user accepts the short sample or asks for the full version.

1. Compare the draft's mechanism with the relevant real-script scene in `screenplay-exemplar-benchmarks.md`; copy no plot, character, setting, or line.
2. Run `screenplay-state-engine.md` to catch continuity, knowledge, causality, and setup/payoff errors.
3. When an explicitly available and allowed fresh reader or isolated context exists, give it only the raw screenplay, locked constraints, and `screenplay-cold-read-protocol.md`; otherwise run the protocol in the current context and label it `SELF-AUDIT ONLY`.
4. Treat logic PASS as a floor. Require the reader also to retell the story, identify obvious unused alternatives, distinguish character voices, and name any line or action that feels written for the author's convenience.
5. Deliver the actual script in the requested form. User acceptance is the only final aesthetic verdict.
